# Fix Summary: Real-Time Data Synchronization ✅

## Problem Solved
**Issue:** When updating product prices (or any data) in the Admin Dashboard, the changes didn't show on the main website until manually refreshing the browser.

**Solution:** Implemented real-time data synchronization with automatic refresh mechanisms.

---

## What Was Changed 🔧

### 1. **Enhanced `useMenu` Hook** (`src/hooks/useMenu.ts`)
✅ Added Supabase real-time subscriptions for `products` table
✅ Added Supabase real-time subscriptions for `product_variations` table
✅ Added window focus detection for automatic refresh
✅ Proper cleanup of subscriptions on unmount

### 2. **Enhanced `useCategories` Hook** (`src/hooks/useCategories.ts`)
✅ Added Supabase real-time subscriptions for `categories` table
✅ Added window focus detection for automatic refresh
✅ Proper cleanup of subscriptions on unmount

### 3. **Updated Main App** (`src/App.tsx`)
✅ Exposed `refreshProducts` function for manual refresh capability

---

## How It Works Now 🚀

### Automatic Refresh Triggers:

1. **Real-Time Database Changes** 📡
   - When you save changes in admin, Supabase notifies all connected clients
   - Website automatically refetches data within 1-2 seconds
   - Works across multiple browser tabs/windows

2. **Window Focus Detection** 👁️
   - When you switch from admin tab back to website tab
   - Automatically refetches latest data
   - Works without any Supabase configuration

3. **Manual Refresh** (Available but not needed)
   - `refreshProducts()` function can be called manually
   - Useful for "Refresh" buttons in future updates

---

## Testing Instructions 🧪

### Quick Test (30 seconds):

1. **Open two browser tabs:**
   ```
   Tab 1: http://localhost:5173          (Main Website)
   Tab 2: http://localhost:5173/admin    (Admin Dashboard)
   ```

2. **In Admin Tab:**
   - Login with password: `Peptivate@Admin!2025`
   - Go to "Manage Products"
   - Edit any product
   - Change the price (e.g., ₱2,500 → ₱3,000)
   - Click "Save"

3. **Switch to Website Tab:**
   - Price updates automatically! 🎉
   - No manual refresh needed
   - Changes appear within 1-2 seconds

### Expected Behavior:

**Before Fix:**
- ❌ Update price → Old price still showing
- ❌ Need to press F5 to see changes
- ❌ Confusing for users

**After Fix:**
- ✅ Update price → New price appears automatically
- ✅ No manual refresh needed
- ✅ Seamless experience

## Supabase Setup (Important!) ⚙️

### For Real-Time to Work:

The **window focus detection** works immediately without setup, but for instant real-time updates, you need to enable Realtime in Supabase:

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard**
   - Navigate to your project

2. **Enable Database Replication:**
   - Go to `Database` → `Replication`
   - Enable replication for these tables:
     - ✅ `products`
     - ✅ `product_variations`
     - ✅ `categories`

3. **Verify API Settings:**
   - Go to `Settings` → `API`
   - Ensure "Enable Realtime" is ON

### Without Realtime Setup:
- Window focus detection still works ✅
- Data refreshes when switching tabs ✅
- Just not "instant" (1-2 second delay vs immediate)

## Technical Details 📋

### Files Modified:
```
src/hooks/useMenu.ts          - Added real-time subscriptions
src/hooks/useCategories.ts    - Added real-time subscriptions
src/App.tsx                   - Exposed refresh function
```

### New Features:
- ✅ Real-time Supabase subscriptions
- ✅ Window focus detection
- ✅ Automatic cleanup on unmount
- ✅ Console logging for debugging
- ✅ Error handling

### Dependencies:
- No new packages needed
- Uses existing Supabase JS client
- Uses native browser Focus API

## Troubleshooting 🔍

### Not working?

**Check 1: Environment Variables**
Ensure `.env` file exists with correct credentials:
```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
```

**Check 2: Browser Console**
Open DevTools (F12) and look for:
```javascript
"Product changed:" {...}
"Window focused - refreshing products..."
```

**Check 3: Network Tab**
- Should see requests to Supabase when switching tabs
- Verify data is actually updated in Supabase

**Check 4: Clear Cache**
- Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
- Clear browser cache if needed

### Still not working?

1. Restart dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Check Supabase project status
3. Verify internet connection
4. Check browser console for errors
